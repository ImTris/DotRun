# Hi, I'm Tristan Benschop.

With over a decade of experience in .NET and Azure technologies, I am passionate about building robust, scalable solutions and sharing my lessons learned with the developer community. I enjoy solving complex problems, mentoring others, and continuously learning new things in the ever-evolving world of software engineering.

Welcome to my site, where I share insights, resources, and stories from my journey in tech.
